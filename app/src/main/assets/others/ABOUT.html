<p><b>Free software, Free society</b><br/>
FSMK is a registered not-for-profit organization whose primary objective is to spread and create awareness about free software technologies amongst different sections of the society. FSMK is driven by volunteers from various backgrounds like software professionals, government officials, academicians and students. The Students Chapter of FSMK works actively with college students and encourages them not only to use free software but also contribute to the development of various free software. We facilitate formation of college-wise units called GNU/Linux User's Group (GLUG) which conduct various technical sessions regularly throughout the academic session.
