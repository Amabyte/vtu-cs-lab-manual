Lab Programs list for Microprocessors Lab as specified by VTU for 4th 
Semester students:

1. a) Search a key element in a list of 'n' 16-bit numbers using the 
Binary search algorithm.
b) Read the status of eight input bits from the Logic Controller Interface 
and display 'FF' if it is the parity of the input read is even; otherwise 
display 00.
2. a) Write two ALP modules stored in two different files; one module is 
to read a character from the keyboard and the other one is to display a 
character. Use the above two modules to read a string of characters from 
the keyboard terminated by the carriage return and print the string on the 
display in the next line.
b) Implement a BCD Up-Down Counter on the Logic Controller Interface.
3. a) Sort a given set of 'n' numbers in ascending order using the Bubble 
Sort algorithm.
b) Read the status of two 8-bit inputs (X & Y) from the Logic Controller 
Interface and display X*Y.
4. a) Read an alphanumeric character and display its equivalent ASCII code 
at the center of the screen.
b) Display messages FIRE and HELP alternately with flickering effects on 
a 7-segment display interface for a suitable period of time. Ensure a 
flashing rate that makes it easy to read both the messages (Examiner does 
not specify these delay values nor is it necessary for the student to 
compute these values).
5. a) Reverse a given string and check whether it is a palindrome or not.
b) Assume any suitable message of 12 characters length and display it in 
the rolling fashion on a 7-segment display interface for a suitable period 
of time. Ensure a flashing rate that makes it easy to read both the 
messages. (Examiner does not specify these delay values nor is it 
necessary for the student to compute these values).
6. a) Read two strings, store them in locations STR1 and STR2. Check 
whether they are equal or not and display appropriate messages. Also 
display the length of the stored strings.
b) Convert a 16-bit binary value (assumed to be an unsigned integer)to 
BCD and display it from left to right and right to left for specified 
number of times on a 7-segment display interface.
7. a) Read your name from the keyboard and display it at a specified 
location on the screen after the message "What is your name?" You must 
clear the entire screen before display.
b) Scan a 8 x 3 keypad for key closure and to store the code of the key 
pressed in a memory location or display on screen. Also display row and 
column numbers of the key pressed.
8. a) Compute nCr using recursive procedure. Assume that 'n' and 'r' are 
non-negative integers.
b) Drive a Stepper Motor interface to rotate the motor in specified 
direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) by N steps (Direction and N 
are specified by the examiner). Introduce suitable delay between 
successive steps. (Any arbitrary value for the delay may be assumed 
by the student).
9. a) Read the current time from the system and display it in the standard 
format on the screen.
b) Generate the Sine Wave using DAC interface (The output of the DAC is 
to be displayed on the CRO).
10. a) Write a program to simulate a Decimal Up-counter to display 00-99.
b) Generate a Half Rectified Sine wave form using the DAC interface. 
(The output of the DAC is to be displayed on the CRO).
11. a) Read a pair of input co-ordinates in BCD and move the cursor to the 
specified location on the screen.
b) Generate a Fully Rectified Sine waveform using the DAC interface. 
(The output of the DAC is to be displayed on the CRO).
12. a) Write a program to create a file (input file) and to delete an 
existing file.
b) Drive an elevator interface in the following way:
i. Initially the elevator should be in the ground floor, with all requests 
in OFF state.
ii. When a request is made from a floor, the elevator should move to 
that floor, wait there for a couple of seconds (approximately), and 
then come down to ground floor and stop. If some requests occur during 
going up or coming down they should be ignored.
