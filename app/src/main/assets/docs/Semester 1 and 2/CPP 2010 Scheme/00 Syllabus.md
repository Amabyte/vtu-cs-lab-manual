Lab Programs list for Computer Programming Lab as specified by VTU for 
1st year students:

1. Design, develop and execute  a program in C to  find and output all 
the roots of a given quadratic equation, for nonzero coefficients.
2. Design, develop and execute a program in C to implement Euclid's 
algorithm to find the GCD and LCM of two integers and to output the 
results along with the given integers.
3. Design, develop and execute  a program in C to  reverse a given four 
digit integer number and check whether it is a palindrome or not. Output 
the given number with suitable message.
4. Design, develop and execute a program in C to evaluate the given 
polynomial f(x) = a 4x4 +  a3x3 + a2x2 + a1x + a0 for given value of x 
and the coefficients using Horner's method.
5. Design, develop and execute a program in C to copy its input to its 
output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank.
6. Design, develop and execute a program in C to input N integer numbers 
in ascending order into a single dimension array, and then to perform a 
binary search for a given key integer number and report success or 
failure in the form of a suitable message.
7. Design, develop and execute a program in C to input N integer numbers 
into a single dimension array, sort them in to ascending order using 
bubble sort technique, and then to print both the given array and the 
sorted array with suitable headings.
8. Design, develop and execute a program in C to compute and print the 
word length on the host machine.
9. Design, develop and execute a program in C to calculate the approximate 
value of exp (0.5) using the Taylor Series expansion for the exponential 
function. Use the terms in the expansion until the last term is less than 
the machine epsilon defines as FLT_EPSILON in the header file <float.h>. 
Print the value returned by the Mathematical function exp ( ) also.
10. Design, develop and execute  a program in C to  read two matrices A 
(M x N) and B (P x Q) and to compute the product of A and B if the 
matrices are compatible for multiplication. The program is to print 
the input matrices and the resultant matrix with suitable headings and 
format if the matrices are compatible for multiplication, otherwise the 
program must print a suitable message. (For the purpose of demonstration, 
the array sizes M, N, P, and Q can all be less than or equal to 3)
11. Design, develop and execute a parallel program in C to add, 
elementwise, two onedimensional arrays A and B of N integer elements 
and to store the result in another onedimensional array C of N integer 
elements.
12. Design and develop a function rightrot (x, n) in C that returns the 
value of the integer x rotated to the right by n bit positions as an 
unsigned integer. Invoke the function from the main with different values 
for x and n and print the results with suitable headings.
13. Design and develop a function isprime (x) that accepts an integer 
argument and returns 1 if the argument is prime and 0 otherwise. The 
function is to use plain division checking approach to determine if a 
given number is prime. Invoke this function from the main with different 
values obtained from the user and print appropriate messages.
14. Design, develop and execute a parallel program in C to determine and 
print the prime numbers which are less than 100 making use of algorithm of 
the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
15. Design and develop a function reverses(s) in C to reverse the strings 
in place. Invoke this function from the main for different strings and 
print the original and reversed strings.
16. Design and develop a function matchany (s1,s2) which returns the first 
location in the string s1 where any character from the string s2 occurs, 
or - 1 if s1 contains  no  character  from   s2.   Do  not   use  the 
standard library function which does a similar job! Invoke the function 
matchany (s1. s2) from the main for different strings and print both the 
strings and the return value from the function matchany (s1,s2).
