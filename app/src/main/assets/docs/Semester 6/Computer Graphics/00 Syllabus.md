Lab Programs list for Computer Graphics and Visualization Lab as specified 
by VTU for 6th Semester students:

1. Program to recursively subdivide a tetrahedron to from 3D Sierpinski 
gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified by the user.
2. Program to implement Liang-Barsky line clipping algorithm.
3. Program to draw a color cube and spin it using OpenGL transformation 
matrices.
4. Program to create a house like figure and rotate it about a given fixed 
point using OpenGL functions.
5. Program to implement the Cohen-Sutherland line-clipping algorithm. Make 
provision to specify the input line, window for clipping and view port for 
displaying the clipped image.
6. Program to create a cylinder and a parallelepiped by extruding a circle 
and quadrilateral respectively. Allow the user to specify the circle and 
the quadrilateral.
7. Program, using OpenGL functions, to draw a simple shaded scene 
consisting of a tea pot on a table. Define suitably the position and 
properties of the light source along with the properties of the properties 
of the surfaces of the solid object used in the scene.
8. Program to draw a color cube and allow the user to move the camera 
suitably to experiment with perspective viewing. Use OpenGL functions.
9. Program to fill any given polygon using scan-line area filling 
algorithm. (Use appropriate data structures.)
10. Program to display a set of values {fij} as a rectangular mesh.

Project:
11. Develop a suitable Graphics package to implement the skills learnt
in the theory and the exercises indicated in Part A. Use the OpenGL.
