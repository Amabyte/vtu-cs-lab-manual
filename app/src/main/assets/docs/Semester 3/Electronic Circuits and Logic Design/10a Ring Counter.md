##AIM
###Design and implement ring counter using 4-bit shift register and demonstrate its working.

##Components used:
 IC 74LS95, Patch chords, Power chords, Trainer Kit.

##Pin Diagram of ICs:
IC-7495

##Theory:
Ring Counter is a basic register with direct feedback such that contents of the register simply circulate around the register when the clock is running. Here last output Qd in a shift register is connected back to the serial input.

##Procedure: 
1.	Verify all components and patch chords whether they are in good condition r not.
2.	Make connection as shown in the circuit diagram.
3.	Give supply to the trainer kit.
4.	Provide input data to circuit via switched.
5.	Verify truth table sequence and observe outputs.
