Lab Programs list for Data Structures using C/C++ Lab as specified by VTU 
for 3rd Semester students:

1. Using circular representation for a polynomial, design, develop, and
execute a program in C to accept two polynomials, add them, and then print 
the resulting polynomial.
2. Design, develop, and execute a program in C to convert a given valid 
parenthesized infix arithmetic expression to postfix expression and then 
to print both the expressions. The expression consists of 12 single character 
operands and the binary operators + (plus), -(minus), * (multiply) 
and / (divide).
3. Design, develop, and execute a program in C to evaluate a valid postfix 
expression using stack. Assume that the postfix expression is read as a 
single line consisting of non-negative single digit operands and binary 
arithmetic operators. The arithmetic operators are +(add), - (subtract), * 
(multiply) and / (divide).
4. Design, develop, and execute a program in C to simulate the working 
of a queue of integers using an array. Provide the following operations:
a. Insert
b. Delete
c. Display
5. Design, develop, and execute a program in C++ based on the following 
requirements: 
An EMPLOYEE class is to contain the following data members and member 
functions:
Data members: Employee_Number (an integer), 
Employee_Name (a string of characters), 
Basic_Salary (an integer) , 
All_Allowances(an integer), 
IT (an integer), 
Net_Salary (an integer).
Member functions: to read the data of an employee, 
to calculate Net_Salary and 
to print the values of all the data members.
(All_Allowances = 123% of Basic; 
Income Tax (IT) = 30% of the gross salary (= basic_Salary _ All_Allowance); 
Net_Salary = Basic_Salary + All_Allowances - IT)
6. Design, develop, and execute a program in C++ to create a class called 
STRING and implement the following operations. Display the results after 
every operation by overloading the operator <<.
i. STRING s1 = "VTU"
ii. STRING s2 = "BELGAUM"
iii. STIRNG s3 = s1 + s2; (Use copy constructor)
7. Design, develop, and execute a program in C++ to create a class called 
STACK using an array of integers and to implement the following operations 
by overloading the operators + and - :
i. s1=s1 + element; 
where s1 is an object of the class STACK
and element is an integer to be pushed on to top of the stack.
ii. s1=s1- ; 
where s1 is an object of the class STACK and - operator pops off the top 
element.
Handle the STACK Empty and STACK Full conditions. Also display the contents 
of the stack after each operation, by overloading the operator <<.
8. Design, develop, and execute a program in C++ to create a class called 
LIST (linked list) with member functions to insert an element at the front 
of the list as well as to delete an element from the front of the list. 
Demonstrate all the functions after creating a list object.
9. Design, develop, and execute a program in C to read a sparse matrix of 
integer values and to search the sparse matrix for an element specified 
by the user. Print the result of the search appropriately. Use the triple 
<row, column, value> to represent an element in the sparse matrix.
10. Design, develop, and execute a program in C to create a max heap
of integers by accepting one element at a time and by inserting it
immediately in to the heap. Use the array representation for the
heap. Display the array at the end of insertion phase.
11. Design, develop, and execute a program in C to implement a doubly
linked list where each node consists of integers. The program should
support the following operations:
i. Create a doubly linked list by adding each node at the front.
ii. Insert a new node to the left of the node whose key value is read as 
an input.
iii. Delete the node of a given data if it is found, otherwise display 
appropriate message.
iv. Display the contents of the list.
(Note: Only either (a,b and d) or (a, c and d) may be asked in the 
examination)
12. Design, develop, and execute a program in C++ to create a class called 
DATE with methods to accept two valid dates in the form dd/mm/yy and to 
implement the following operations by overloading the operators + and -. 
After every operation the results are to be displayed by overloading the 
operator <<.
i. no_of_days = d1 - d2; where d1 and d2 are DATE objects, d1 >=d2 and 
no_of_days is an integer.
ii. d2 = d1 + no_of_days; where d1 is a DATE object and no_of_days is 
an integer.
13. Design, develop, and execute a program in C++ to create a class called 
OCTAL, which has the characteristics of an octal number.
Implement the following operations by writing an appropriate constructor 
and an overloaded operator +.
i. OCTAL h = x ; where x is an integer
ii. int y = h + k ; where h is an OCTAL object and k is an integer.
Display the OCTAL result by overloading the operator <<. Also display the 
values of h and y.
14. Design, develop, and execute a program in C++ to create a class called
BIN_TREE that represents a Binary Tree, with member functions to perform 
inorder, preorder and postorder traversals.
Create a BIN_TREE object and demonstrate the traversals.
