that collects the USN ( the valid format is: A digit from 1 to 4 followed
by two upper-case characters followed by two digits followed by two
upper-case characters followed by three digits; no embedded spaces

  1. Develop and demonstrate, using Javascript script, a XHTML document 
that contains three short paragraphs of text, stacked on top of each other,
with only enough of each showing so that the mouse cursor can be placed
over some part of them. When the cursor is placed over the exposed part of 
any paragraph, it should rise to the top to become completely visible.
  2. Modify the above document so that when a paragraph is moved from the 
top stacking position, it returns to its original position rather than to
the bottom.
